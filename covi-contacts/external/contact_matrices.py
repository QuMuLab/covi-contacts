    Given that we are aggregating data from various sources, it is required that we adjust for the underlying assumptions.
    One of these structural assumption is of age groups. Contact matrices available consider only 16 classes while we assume 17 classes.

    Args:
        P_AGE (list): each element is a list of 3 elements - min age in the group, max age in the group, proportion of population that falls in this age group
            expects a total of 17 elements (age groups) in this list
        POPULATION_SIZE (int): total size of the population
